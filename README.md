# COMP0137 Machine Vision: Coursework 2

This is my attempt to solve the problems in Coursework 2.

There are 3 sections for this coursework:
1. 06_Practical_Homographies - Previous lab on homographies. The two main tasks are stitching 3 images together into a panoramic image using homographies and projeting a 3D wireframe cube onto a square plane pattern in a static image.
2. 07_PracticalCondensation - Previous lab on condensation. Tracking the car tire in video frames using particle filter and brownian motion model.
3. HW2 - Track and project a 3D cube on top of a given pattern in video frames, by making use of the code written in lab 06 and lab 07.
